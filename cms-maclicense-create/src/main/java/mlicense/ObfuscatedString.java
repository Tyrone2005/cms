/**
 * A utility class used to replace string literals in Java source code with an
 * obfuscated representation of the string.
 * Client applications should use this class to implement the
 * {@link de.schlichtherle.license.LicenseParam},
 * {@link de.schlichtherle.license.KeyStoreParam}
 * and {@link de.schlichtherle.license.CipherParam} interfaces in order to
 * make it considerably hard (although still not impossible) for a reverse
 * engineer to find these string literals while providing comparably fast
 * operation and minimum memory footprint.
 * <p>
 * To use this class you need to provide the string literal to obfuscate as a
 * parameter to the static {@link #obfuscate} method.
 * Its return value is a string which contains the Java code which you should
 * substitute for the string literal in the client application's source code.
 * <p>
 * Please note that obfuscation is <em>not</em> equal to encryption:
 * In contrast to the obfuscation provided by this class, encryption is
 * comparably slow and expensive in terms of resources - no matter what
 * algorithm is actually used.
 * More importantly, encrypting string literals in Java code does not really
 * increase the privacy of these strings compared to obfuscation as long as
 * the encryption key is still placed in the Java code itself and tracing the
 * calls to the JVM is possible.
 * Hence, obfuscation is selected in favour of encryption. 
 * <p>
 * In order to provide a reasonable level of security for your application,
 * you should <em>always</em> obfuscate the <em>application code</em> too,
 * including this class.
 * Otherwise, a reverse engineer could simply use the UNIX "strings" utility
 * to search for all usages of this class, which would render its use
 * completely pointless!
 * In case you're looking for a Java code obfuscation tool for this task,
 * please consider ProGuard, available and usable for free at
 * <a href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net">http://proguard.sourceforge.net</a>.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be thread safe.
